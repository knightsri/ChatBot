In addition\nto possessing real world knowledge of a competitive, software\nmarketplace, I offer proficiency in the analysis, architecture, design,\nand development of software applications.\n\nWith solid experience in goal-setting and team-building within the\ncompanies that I have worked, I bring a strong background of technical\nexpertise and leadership in development of software solutions. I combine\nthis with a strong educational background, including a double-Masters\nand a verifiable track record in the creation of innovative software.\n\nI have a strong love of problem solving, which has led me to adopt\ntechnology for the business process and create order even, sometimes, in\na chaotic business environment. Having worked with numerous technologies\n(cloud computing, client-server, system integration, web-based\napplications, database design, open source solutions) and programming\nlanguages (C/C++, C#, Perl/PHP/ASP, Java/J2EE, .NET) and methodologies\n(n-tier, middle-ware, XML) and middleware (MQ-Series) and relational\ndatabases (Oracle, Sybase, MySQL, Informix and Ingres) and\nweb-technologies (Apache, IIS, Application servers like\nDynamo-WebLogic-WebSphere). I can quite confidently say I am a software\nengineer at heart, who has learned to work effectively in a\ngoal-oriented, business environment, relating effectively to members of\nmy teams and higher management.\n\nAs I enjoy challenges, I often bring an unusual appetite for technical\ndifficulties that can, at times, create an unusual confidence in\ncircumstances that would otherwise seem somewhat difficult. But this is\nmy approach and it has brought me recognition within my circles as an\noptimistic and successful problem solver. This approach has been helpful\nto those I have worked with, since it has been combined with the\nconcrete experience of participating in software development teams of\nvarying in sizes (from 2 to 22 developers). With this background and\napproach, I am confident I can fit in any team and tackle any complex\nproject that you may have. I am sure I can be a valuable asset to your\norganization.\n\nI have enclosed a copy of my resume. I look forward to talking with you\nsoon regarding new opportunities within your company.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Srinivas Bolisetty)\n",

I would be happy to get 120K as a full-time salary as a\nDeveloper in the Dallas area. In return, I am sure to get a multi-fold value back to the organization. As a\nconsultant or contract worker, I would be happy to get between $70 to $75 per hour. I have always made\norganizations feel they got me at a bargain no matter how much they paid me. The challenge in a job is\nwhat brings best in me and I have always enjoyed making everyone around me better along the way.\nAppreciate the heads up on Sulakshana's positions. Here is my response to the position you shared with\nme.\n\n> • Strong programming experience in Angular (2 and above), Java, Java Struts 2.x, JDBC, JNDI, Spring, JSON,\nNode.js, JavaScript, Maven, JUnit and Oracle PL/SQL.\nYes for all the technologies except for Spring. Designed an original framework that is very similar to Struts before\nit even released. I have done extensive work in JDBC based middleware and always enjoyed automating\neverything.\n\n> • Significant Experience in Restful Web services and Advanced Java programming\nYes. Used Core Java and JDBC to provide restful web-services based framework to replace the traditional\nbusiness layers. The end-to-end automation was setup in a way that the web-portals were deployed with minimal\nor no work from the Development team. The business team used to put the content together, test the sites and\nwork with Development team in deploying the finished portal. It was fun to watch and build web-portals without\ndoing any work.\n\n> • Working knowledge on Unix/Linux and Shell scripting.\nYes, of course. Been self sufficient and usually do my own automation thru various scripting methods - whether\nthey are Shell or Perl/PHP.\n\n> • Experience in Website/Portal development\nYes, like the back of my hand. I always enjoyed teaching and mentoring others around me in building portals the\nbetter way - in terms of security, extensible and maintainability.\n\n> • Design, develop and integrate services in large-scale distributed enterprise infrastructures (cloud etc.)\nYes, worked with all 3 major clouds - AWS (since 2007), GCP (since 2017), Azure (since 2015). Before the Cloud\nas we know it, worked with VMWare in setting up test-environments thru scripting for build-up and tear-down\nprocesses in a SDLC.\n\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=d2af758ead&view=pt&search=all&permmsgid=msg-a:r2463277173249442022&simpl=msg-a:r246327717324944…\n\n1/2\n\n\f4/23/25, 11:26 AM\n\nGmail - Insight Global Follow Up - Bank of America\n\n> • CI/CD tools ( JIRA, Jenkins, Ansible, BitBucket, Sonar, jFrog)\nYes, worked with many CI/CD toolsets at multiple times. Worked with JIRA (and others as well) including\nadministration and setup. Worked with BitBucket counterparts like SVN, GIT. Familiar with Ansible but not directly\nworked with Sonar or jFrog.\n\n> • Develop, enhance, debug, support, maintain and test software applications on diverse development\nplatforms, software, hardware, technologies and tools.\nYes, that is the life of a developer. No matter what the tool or technology (Microsoft Stack or WAMP or LAMP or\nCustom Development Platform) is the fundamentals doesn't change that much. We only learn more about\neffectively using them as the time passes.\n\n> • Good to have experience in Restful Web services and Advanced Java programming with Java, Java Struts,\nspring, JSON, Angular-JS, Ant, Maven and Oracle PL/SQL\nVery comfortable with everything here having worked with all of them, except for Spring. Wrote my own ANT and\ndebugged others to know and improve things overall.\n\n> Plusses:\n> • Good communication and analytical skills. Capable of working as a team player regionally and globally.\n> • Capable of working in Agile environment\n\nBeen working with Agile since 2006 and worked with many tools and methods along the way. Not shy of learning new\nthings and adopting to the situations. I have always strived to make the computer my tool and than the other way around.\nThe only way I do that is to understand the current process, what the goals are and figure out how to head there with the\ntools that I have in my hand. If I need more tools or machines to get something done - I have done that with a proof-ofconcept implementation or through an example. I excel in technology, grasping the complex systems, coming up with\nstrategy and design and implementing that no matter how hard it may get. I am a very passionate individual when it\ncomes to technology and even more passionate about getting things done the right way.\n-Sri\n[Quoted text hidden]\n\n---Sri\n\nLet the world share the light within you - Anonymous\n\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=d2af758ead&view=pt&search=all&permmsgid=msg-a:r2463277173249442022&simpl=msg-a:r246327717324944…\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

He is a great architect, but also\nflexible and able to come up with timely solutions. His software expertise is broad, and he is very capable in both\ndeveloping as well as operationalizing a project. Srinivas built and led our development center in India, while managing\nour US dev team. He is widely respected throughout the organization. Srinivas is an incredibly valuable member of our\nteam, and I would be excited to work with him again.\" August 29, 2008\nBill Hunt, Vice President of Engineering, Habeas\nmanaged Srinivas at Habeas Inc.\n\"Srinivas is one of those rare gems - a supremely good individual software engineer in his own right, and an outstanding\nmanager and leader of his team! Any problem, anywhere - Srinivas will solve it. And under his guidance his teams\nproduce outstanding results to complement his own achievements.

He could listen to any issue or business case brought to him and present\nsound options for solving the problem. At times, the solution would simply materialize literally overnight when all that was\npromised was that \"He'd look into it.\" When things were more challenging than that, Srinivas was able to present clear\noptions and explain the trade offs required and have a calm, rational discussion about the options. Once an agreement\nwas in place, he worked like the wind to move forward.

He has the ability to jump\ninto any aspect of the project, to effectively work with vendors in getting the agreed upon deliverables and rigorously\nhandpick and grow a high quality technical team from scratch! Srinivas is always on the lookout for how things can be\nmade more efficient across enginnering and how the time it takes to do a task can be reduced without compromising\nquality! I also like the fact that he is a down to earth approachable person - if you connect with him and listen, there is a lot\nyou will learn!

At PICI, when you realigned the development teams to adopt more\nagile practices in product delivery, what improvements did you see?\nSpecifically, do you have a number or data to support it?\n\nImprovements are:\n\n-   Streamlined SDLC from inceptions to deployment and operations\n\n-   Quick design to development (from months to weeks)\n\n-   Quality product (poorly managed product to well planned feature\n    delivery that provided guidance to what to expect in release after\n    release)\n\nSome of the quantifiable numbers include:\n\n-   A report used to take anywhere from weeks to months to analyse and\n    deliver. With the framework in place, the report can be delivered\n    within days to a couple of weeks at the most.\n\n-   A new application was usually months and year+ in the making. That\n    time was reduced to within a month for an application to be deployed\n    in Production with clear features pipeline identified and\n    communicated.\n\n-   Before I took over, there was a team of 30 individuals supporting\n    about 6 applications and many loosely supported processes and\n    reports. I managed that to be 17 individuals supporting 22\n    applications with no more loose processes along the way.\n\n-   Clinical Trial Data was requested and searched thru by a small group\n    of people with access to Clinical Trial Systems. Sometimes this\n    \"searches\" take up to weeks to get a simple questions such as \"how\n    many subjects are enrolled in a study\". One of the applications that\n    I managed to build this eliminated \"this group of individuals\" and\n    made this information at the fingertips of anyone who is supposed to\n    have access to the trial-data. No more \"waiting\", period.\n\n-   Building Clinical Trial Forms was a long drawn process. Under my\n    guidance this became standardized with utilizing Global Forms that\n    define structure, syntax, semantics of how the data is organized,\n    managed and labeled. This greatly helped in how we utilize this\n    information in analyzing the data post capture.\n\n4\\. At PICI, when you built a uniform dashboard for easy to access\nclinical and non-clinical purposes, what improvements did you see?\nSpecifically, do you have a number or data to support it?\n\nMany a times a question that is asked and responded over email is\nconverted into putting the data in a form that is easily digestible and\nusable from end-user directly. This tends to generate more \"interesting\"\nfacts and trends in a business user that drives insights into features\n(they can be business opportunities or optimizing certain\ninefficiencies). Here are a couple of points in this regard:\n\n-   Our Finance department used to get \"invoice\" for the work that is\n    supposedly completed on a clinical trial. Having a clinical-trial\n    dashboard online at their fingertips, the finance team is now\n    equipped to at least cross check whether work \"invoiced\" is actually\n    complete or not and follow up with either Clinical Team or our\n    sister organization to inquire in a more quantitative manner.\n\n-   Our Clinical Teams are supposed to oversee the work being done on\n    the trial. With an effective dashboard at their fingertips, they are\n    no able to see the quality of work as well as time-sensitive issues\n    in a more timely manner and follow up with sites to get on the\n    important tasks first.\n\n5\\. At Habeas, how many clients did you acquire by scaling out the\napplication architecture on demand before the PaaS and Iaas days? What\nresults happened because of this, numbers wise?\n\n-   The total number of clients went from 20+ to 80 in about 2 years\n    (quadrupled)\n\n-   The data gew from 1X to 25X in about 2 months (a handful of BIG\n    clients tend to do that)\n\nThe architecture is key to addressing \"customer\" and \"data\" growth\nalike.\n\n6\\. When you mentioned in your resume that you setup and managed\nclinical systems for conducting phase 1A/1B and phase 2 clinical trials;\nwhat job position did this occur in?\n\nThis is for PICI - a startup in Immunotherapy area. We grew at a fast\npace and I led the team that setup all the initial Clinical Systems that\nhelped bring up first 4 studies online. Some of the work was done by\nfolks in-house and some by consultants.\n",
