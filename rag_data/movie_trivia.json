      "content": "The mechanical shark, nicknamed 'Bruce' after Spielberg's lawyer, constantly malfunctioned due to saltwater damage. This forced Spielberg to show the shark less, accidentally creating more suspense. The famous line 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' was improvised by Roy Scheider. Filming ran over budget and schedule so badly that Universal almost shut it down. Despite the chaos, it became the first 'summer blockbuster' and invented modern movie marketing. The Indianapolis speech by Robert Shaw was partially written by him while drunk.",

The studio wanted anyone but Brando and Pacino—they suggested Robert Redford and Ryan O'Neal for Michael.

The film cost $200 million, making it the most expensive movie ever at the time—many predicted it would flop. The drawing Jack makes of Rose was actually drawn by Cameron himself (his hands appear in the scene). The elderly couple seen embracing in bed as water floods in were based on real passengers, Isidor and Ida Straus, who refused to be separated. Kate Winslet was one of the few cast members who didn't wear a wetsuit, which led to her getting pneumonia.",
